# neuralnetwork-learning
My first attempt at a neural network. 

MNIST loader NOT my work, the only change I made to the original was to make the zips python3 friendly by turning them into lists. The program and neuralnetwork python files are built by me following the tutorial at neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.
